# 🩺 Audit Analytics – Liver Patient Risk Prediction  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project predicts the likelihood of **liver disease** in patients using **machine learning techniques**.  
By analyzing healthcare data and identifying key risk factors, the model helps doctors and researchers make early, data-driven interventions for better patient outcomes.  

The project compares two algorithms — **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** — to identify which performs best in classifying liver patients based on their medical attributes.

## 🧠 Model Development  

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values.  
- Encoded categorical columns (e.g., Gender).  
- Normalized numerical features for uniform scaling.  

### 🔹 Step 2: Model Training  
- Built **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models.  
- Split data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.  

### 🔹 Step 3: Hyperparameter Tuning  
Used **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal parameters for Random Forest, improving accuracy and stability.  

### 🔹 Step 4: Model Evaluation  
Evaluated both models based on key metrics:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Recall**  
- **AUC Score**  

| Model | Accuracy | Insights |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 71.5% | Simple, interpretable baseline model |
| Random Forest | 75–80% | More robust and accurate after tuning |
